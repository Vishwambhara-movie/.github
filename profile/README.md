## Teaser Reception  

The teaser was released amidst mixed reactions from fans.

Comparisons to recent Hollywood films have surfaced, suggesting a lack of originality in the visual style.  

## Visual Quality Concerns  

Many viewers expected a high-quality visual experience, but the teaser did not meet these expectations.
